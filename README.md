# Drum-Kit
A fun and interactive drum kit website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Click on the drum buttons (w, a, s, d, j, k, l) or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play different drum sounds. This project demonstrates event handling, audio playback, and dynamic UI interactions.
